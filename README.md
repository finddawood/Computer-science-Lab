# Portfolio Project

## Overview

This portfolio project showcases my technical skills and competencies in web development, documentation, and data analysis. It is designed to present a comprehensive view of my qualifications as a working student in computer science and related fields. The portfolio consists of three main components:

1. **Portfolio Website**: A responsive website that highlights my academic background, technical skills, and project experiences.
2. **LaTeX CV**: A well-structured and professional curriculum vitae created using LaTeX, showcasing my educational qualifications and technical proficiencies.
3. **Analytics Task**: A data analysis project conducted using Python, demonstrating my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Contents

### 1. Portfolio Website

The portfolio website is hosted on GitHub Pages and serves as an online platform to present my skills and experiences in a user-friendly format.

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Key Features**:
  - Responsive design for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones
  - Clear navigation structure with links to key sections: Home, Education, Experience
  - Visually engaging elements, including images and interactive components

### 2. LaTeX CV

The LaTeX CV is an integral part of my portfolio, emphasizing professionalism and clarity.

- **Technologies Used**: LaTeX (with fontawesome and geometry packages)
- **Key Features**:
  - Structured layout with sections for personal information, education, certifications, technical skills, and project experiences
  - Clear and uniform formatting to enhance readability

### 3. Analytics Task

This project illustrates my ability to analyze real-world datasets using Python and machine learning techniques.

- **Dataset**: Loan approval status based on various applicant features (credit score, income, employment status, etc.)
- **Technologies Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and patterns
  - Implementation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict loan approval status
